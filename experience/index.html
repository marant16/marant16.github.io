<p>A commercial firm was facing the risk of significant government fines due to errors in their manual data entry process. I created a system that could accurately digitalize their 3,000+ printed invoices and tickets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Developed a simple mobile-friendly web interface allowing employees to upload photographs of documents directly from their phones.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Document Processing:</strong> Architected a data extraction pipeline using an ensemble of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engines and LMMs (large multimodal models) to maximize accuracy. This included a fallback system to flag ambiguous data for human verification.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Validation:</strong> Reverse-engineered the national tax authority&rsquo;s (SUNAT) web portal to build a service that automatically validated every digitalized invoice against the official government database.</li>
<li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Wrote the validated, structured data into a clean database for the client&rsquo;s use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Outcome:</strong> The system successfully processed the documents with an extremely low error rate, protecting the company from government fines.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, LLM APIs, OCR Libraries, Web Scraping, SQL databases.</p>

  <strong>Project 2: Custom OCR for Handwritten Invoices in a Tax Fraud Defense Case</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#project-2-custom-ocr-for-handwritten-invoices-in-a-tax-fraud-defense-case">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A company accused of tax fraud struggled with their legal defense since they lacked a digital accounting workflow, I turned their 8,000+ handwritten documents into a digital database with high accuracy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Annotation:</strong> Set up and managed a local instance of Label Studio (OSS) to coordinate a team of labelers, which allowed to collect training data for our custom models.</li>
<li><strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong> Implemented a pipeline of image processing techniques to improve OCR accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Model Development:</strong> Fine-tuned a Faster R-CNN object detection model to accurately segment and identify key fields (dates, amounts, company names) within the structure of the handwritten invoices.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Extraction:</strong> Integrated the custom-trained models with external APIs and fallback mechanisms to create a resilient and accurate data extraction process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Outcome:</strong> Developed a system capable of processing their irregular, handwritten documents with great accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Label Studio, Pandas, LMM APIs.</p>

  <strong>Project 3: Secure, Searchable Index of a 10GB Legal Case File</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#project-3-secure-searchable-index-of-a-10gb-legal-case-file">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A team of court-appointed accountants needed to make a report on the finances of a few individuals involved in a case with a large, unorganized court-file. I delivered a tool with ready to use search functionality across the entire file.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Strategy:</strong> Performed exploratory data analysis using vector embeddings and clustering to understand the document landscape and create an intelligent sampling strategy for labeling.</li>
<li><strong>Process Optimization:</strong> Benchmarked various OCR methods on cost, speed, and accuracy to select the optimal approach.</li>
<li><strong>Final Delivery:</strong> Processed and indexed the entire 10GB dataset. The final product was a ready-to-use solution delivered via Recoll (an open-source desktop search tool), allowing the client to instantly perform searches on the entire case file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Outcome:</strong> Transformed a chaotic 10GB data dump into a usable record, allowing the legal team to find information effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Sentence Transformers, Scikit-learn, OCR Libraries, Pandas, Recoll, Docker.</p>

<p>One of the core ways I learn new stuff is by attempting to solve problems and build tools outside of my confort zone.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML Framework Internals:</strong> I felt like learning more about Machine Learning and OSS. I begun researching how to come up with a solution to a <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad">Tinygrad</a> bounty, in the process I learned more about ML, how GPUs work and the dynamics of open source colaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Full-Stack Application:</strong> I wanted to understand more about how general, user facing projects work from start to end. I began developing a full-stack web application using React and JavaScript. The goal was building an application with monetized services around the custom invoice digitalization models I had trained.</li>
